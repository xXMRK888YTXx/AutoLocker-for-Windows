# AutoLocker-for-Windows
This program is designed to lock the computer in case you have moved away from it. The program works as follows. The program runs two threads, one monitors the status of the workstation (locked or unlocked), the second monitors the position of the mouse and pressing the keyboard. If during the time specified in the settings, there were no mouse movements and keyboard clicks, then the workstation is blocked (equivalent to a combination of Win +L).

If the workstation is locked (by whom, it does not matter), mouse and keyboard tracking will pause, and when unblocked, it will automatically continue.
